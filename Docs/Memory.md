## Key Decisions Made

### Technical Decisions
- **âœ… Authentication**: Supabase Auth with email/password (no magic links)
- **âœ… State Management**: React Context for auth, hooks for data fetching
- **âœ… API Integration**: Separate service layers for Congress.gov and GovTrack
- **âœ… Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data
- **âœ… UI Pattern**: Modal-based authentication over separate pages

### Architecture Decisions
- **âœ… App Structure**: Conditional rendering based on auth state
- **âœ… Component Organization**: Separate auth components in dedicated folder
- **âœ… Service Layer**: Clean separation between API services and UI
- **âœ… Error Handling**: Consistent error patterns across all services
